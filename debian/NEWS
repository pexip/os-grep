grep (3.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  To temporarily workaround some issues with the debian building and ci
  infrastructure, this Debian grep release temporarily disables the stray
  backlash warning. Upstream behaviour can be enabled back again by setting
  the DEB_GREP_ENABLE_STRAY_BACKSLASH_WARN envvar.

  Since regular expressions with stray backslashes could lead to unexpected
  results, the patch applied in this release will be reverted in the future.

grep (3.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This Debian grep release removes the deprecation warning about egrep and
  fgrep. These alternative programs will be still shipped by Debian. Although,
  for portability reasons, users are encouraged to use grep with the concerned
  options instead of those alternative programs.

grep (3.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream's NEWS:

  The egrep and fgrep commands, which have been deprecated since
  release 2.5.3 (2007), now warn that they are obsolescent and should
  be replaced by grep -E and grep -F.

  To follow upstream's behaviour, the Debian-specific rgrep command is
  obsolescent. For the moment, it is just no longer documeted.

  More upstream NEWS:

  The confusing GREP_COLOR environment variable is now obsolescent.
  Instead of GREP_COLOR='xxx', use GREP_COLORS='mt=xxx'.  grep now
  warns if GREP_COLOR is used and is not overridden by GREP_COLORS.
  Also, grep now treats GREP_COLOR like GREP_COLORS by silently
  ignoring it if it attempts to inject ANSI terminal escapes.

  Regular expressions with stray backslashes now cause warnings, as
  their unspecified behavior can lead to unexpected results.
  For example, '\a' and 'a' are not always equivalent
  <https://bugs.gnu.org/39678>.  Similarly, regular expressions or
  subexpressions that start with a repetition operator now also cause
  warnings due to their unspecified behavior; for example, *a(+b|{1}c)
  now has three reasons to warn.  The warnings are intended as a
  transition aid; they are likely to be errors in future releases.

  Regular expressions like [:space:] are now errors even if
  POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, since POSIX now allows the GNU behavior.

grep (3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream's NEWS:

  The GREP_OPTIONS environment variable no longer affects grep's behavior.
  The variable was declared obsolescent in grep 2.21 (2014), and since
  then any use had caused grep to issue a diagnostic.
